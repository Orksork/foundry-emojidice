Also I'm forking from LorduFreeman's ['Lordu's Custom Dice for Dice So Nice!'](https://github.com/LorduFreeman/foundry-lordudice) to figure out how to make the dice so I'm just gonna use his README formatting too. Bully for me.

## About/How to use
This module can only be used in conjunction with **Dice So Nice! (minimum version required 3.1.0)** and adds some dice. You can find them in the Dice So Nice setting if you look.

### How to use and combine styles
